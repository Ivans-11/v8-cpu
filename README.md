# Simple 8-bit V8-CPU Simulator with Assembler/C-subset Compiler
V8-CPU simulator is used for labs& exercises on first-year(freshman) undergraduate CS course "An Overview of Computer Science" in Dept. of CS in Tsinghua Univ. This simulator provides a simplified assembler/C syntax and is simulating a simple 8-bit RISC cpu. Press Help inside the simulator to see an overview about the supported instructions, which is based on Appendix C contents in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Overview-12th-Edition/dp/0133760065" target="_blank">Computer Science: An Overview</a> textbook.

### Features
- 8-bit RISC CPU
- 15 general purpose registers
- program counter register
- 1 timer count-downregister
- 256 bytes of memory
- a printer(like a output serial)
- assembler (see 'assemble' button)
- binary code/data uploader(see 'upload' button)
- several assembly code example(see 'Examples' list)
- 4KB disk (To Be Done)
- C-subset compiler (To Be Done)

### How to build
Make sure you have <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> installed to compile the `asmsimulator.js` script.

steps in ubuntu 16.04 x64
```
sudo apt install npm nodejs-legacy  php7.0-cli
alias cnpm="npm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org \
--cache=$HOME/.npm/.cache/cnpm \
--disturl=https://npm.taobao.org/dist \
--userconfig=$HOME/.cnpmrc"
cd v8-cpu
cnpm install
cnpm grunt-cli
./node_modules/.bin/grunt
cd cucu
make install
cd ..
./node_modules/.bin/grunt http
```

Run `npm install && grunt` to build the project and `grunt http` to run.
